# causality

Causality is a collection of quantified self projects with a goal to better understand my personal health and behaviour. Using a variety of technologies, it aims to pull data from a wide variety of services and devices. For example, usage data from TikTok and Spotify can be analysed alongside health data from iOS. This project also includes analyses of SQLite databases containing Apple iMessage data and data from the To-do list app Things 3. Causality is an ongoing project that I hope to develop and release with the hope that it can help other people understand their own lives.
